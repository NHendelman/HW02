## **Word Usage for Obama Tweets in Jan 2012**

This graph shows the amount of times Obama used a specific word in his tweets of January 2012. I got the data from [data.world's Obama dataset](https://data.world/socialmediadata/obama-white-house-social-media-obamawhitehouse-tweets). It seems like he loves talking about himself much more than Michelle.
