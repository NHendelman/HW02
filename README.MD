## **Word Usage for Obama Tweets in Jan 2012**

This graph shows the amount of times Obama used a specific word in his tweets of January 2012. I got the data from [Data.world's Obama dataset(tweets/2012_01.js)](https://data.world/socialmediadata/obama-white-house-social-media-obamawhitehouse-tweets/workspace/file?filename=tweets%2F2012_01.js). It seems like he loves talking about himself much more than Michelle.

## **Word Usage Comaprison for Jan 2012 and Jan 2013**

Here I compared our previous data to Obama's usage of the same words in January of 2013, a year later. I again got the data from [Data.world's Obama dataset(tweets/2013_01.js](https://data.world/socialmediadata/obama-white-house-social-media-obamawhitehouse-tweets/workspace/file?filename=tweets%2F2013_01.js) Jan2012 refers to the amount he used the word in January of 2012, and Jan2013 refers to the amount he used the word in January of 2013. I was very surprised how the word "the" was used almost the same amount over both months.
