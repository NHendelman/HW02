## **Word Usage for Obama Tweets in Jan 2012**

This graph shows 6 words that Obama has used in his tweets of January 2012, and displays their prevelance in a pie chart. The specific values for each word were 'Obama' 169, 'USA' 4, 'State' 28, 'Economy' 19, 'The' 238, and 'Michelle' 4, but the pie displays them as percentages. I got the data from [data.world's Obama dataset(tweets/2012_01.js)](https://data.world/socialmediadata/obama-white-house-social-media-obamawhitehouse-tweets/workspace/file?filename=tweets%2F2012_01.js). It seems like he loves talking about himself much more than Michelle.

## **Word Usage Comaprison for Jan 2012 and Jan 2013**

Here I compared how many times Obama used the same words in tweets a year later. The data comes from [data.world's Obama dataset(tweets/2013_01.js.](https://data.world/socialmediadata/obama-white-house-social-media-obamawhitehouse-tweets/workspace/file?filename=tweets%2F2013_01.js) Jan2012 refers to the amount he used the word in January of 2012, and Jan2013 refers to the amount he used the word in January of 2013. I was very surprised how the word "the" was used almost exactly the same amount over both months.
